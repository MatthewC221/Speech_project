#### Subsolution to speech recognition MAJOR PROJECT 
Currently being developed

#### Two main components are: syllable separation and MFCC computation
##### Syllable separation: 
Applied RMS block processing on PCM (syl.py)
##### MFCC computation: 
Applied hanning window and FFT on PCM, compute power of triangular filters
##### Other random components:
yes_no.py (way to separate yes and no)
##### Data:
The data I have created won't be uploaded onto github, currently has ~50 .wav files
